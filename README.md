# UaicMap

UaicMap is a web application developed to facilitate the navigation and orientation within the main building of "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" University in Iași. The application provides an interactive way to find routes between various locations within the building, offering an intuitive and easy-to-use interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Navigation**: Easily navigate through the university's building.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be intuitive and easy for users to interact with.
- **Polymorphism Implementation**: Utilizes polymorphism principles in object-oriented programming (OOP) to manage different types of entities in the application.
- **Current Location**: Scanning a qr code like the one below will mark the current location, as if the qr code was on the door of said room.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPA). React's component-based architecture helps in creating reusable UI components.
- **Leaflet**: A JavaScript library for interactive maps. It is simple, lightweight, and provides the core features needed for map integration.
- **React-Leaflet**: A JavaScript library that leverages the power of React and functionality of Leaflet to create interactive maps in React.
